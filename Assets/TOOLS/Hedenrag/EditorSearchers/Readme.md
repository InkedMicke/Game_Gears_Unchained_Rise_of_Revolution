## Editor Searcher

Editor searcher works by searching all objects of one type in your project and returns them, it is only recomended for testing, debugging or editor baking scripts. It is not very optimized and **cannot be used in runtime** (you can use it in editor but it wont compile even if you take it out of the editor folder).
